with shown resistors values, (51K, 10K) board does not need any calibration, better if you use 1% type
IF you need to calibrate, there are 3 pins in the lower part of the board. shortening the mid one with the rightmost one, will decrease the voltage reading. Shorten the middle one with the leftmost pin, will increase. once set, data is saevd in eeprom

use pickit2, pickit3, pickit 4 to program board. only 4 pins are used: Vpp (dotted one), GND, PGD, PGC
 Power the board from the two right pins, up to 6S (only vista)
 Power air unit or vista on the left side. pins from upper side are +V, GND, TX, RX. same sequence as air unit cable
